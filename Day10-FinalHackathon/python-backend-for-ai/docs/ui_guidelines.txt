# UI & UX Best Practices

## Layout & Spacing
- Employ 8‑pixel base spacing: 8, 16, 24, 32px for padding/margins to create visual harmony.
- Utilize modular grid systems: 12-column grid for content and responsive adjustments.
- Ensure consistent touch targets ≥44×44px for accessible tap zones.

## Typography & Readability
- Maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA).
- Use semantic headings (h1–h3) with decreasing font sizes for logical hierarchy.
- Avoid body font sizes <14px; for mobile, 16px+. Text left-aligned for readability.

## Interaction
- Provide visible focus states, hover effects, and CTR animations.
- Keep animations simple: duration <200ms, no motion-triggered seizures.

## Accessibility
- Use aria-label for non-text links/buttons.
- Avoid color-only indicators; use text + icons.
- Offer skip-to-main links in HTML for navigation.
